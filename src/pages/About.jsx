      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Foodie— where every recipe tells a story. We’re a small team
        of food enthusiasts, home cooks, and flavor explorers who believe that
        great meals start with simple ingredients and a dash of creativity. Our
        mission is to bring you tried-and-true recipes that are easy to follow,
        delicious to eat, and perfect for every occasion — whether it's a quick
        weekday dinner or a weekend feast.

        We started this site because we were tired of sifting through
        complicated, untested recipes online. We wanted a space where you could
        trust that what you cook will actually work. Everything here has been
        tested in real kitchens.
      </p>
      <p>
        What You'll Find Here are Curated Recipes: From comforting classics to
        fresh new favorites, we cover all skill levels.
